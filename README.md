First create an simple index.html file with "Hello, world! &  This is my first site hosted on GitHub Pages." content in it.
Create a Directory on EC2 machine and add a index.html file in it.
And push into the github repo with using commands and username & PAT Token.
Enable GitHub Pages
Go to your repo → Settings → Pages
Under Build and deployment, select:
Source → Deploy from a branch
Branch → main
Folder → / (root) and save. 

And this is how I create My first static website using Github pages.
